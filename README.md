# E-Commerce-Backend

In this challenege we were tasked to create a E-commerce backend application to seed sql tables with products,tags, and categories. Using insomnia, I was able to check the Api's for each of the three and use GET,POST,PUT, and delete routes to edit the objects for the categories, products, and tags. I also used .js files for the models and established their relationship to one another. In the files you can see I also have the Api routes and seeds to populate the sql tables that allowed me to edit them through insomnia.
